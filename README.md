# Integral-Grapher
During the Fall quarter of my Freshman year, I was taking a Calculus course, and I was learning about antiderivatives, or integrals. I kept wondering, what exactly was this is a physical sense? I knew that I could imagine derivatives as slopes of graphs at certain points, but I couldnâ€™t understand how to imagine integrals. After thinking for a while, I realized that integrals could be thought of as points in which the y coordinate of a point has the value of the slope of the tangent line at that point in the function whose integral is being taken. To prove this, I decided to make a program that can take a simple function like y = x^2 and graph the integral of it, using the procedure I described. I learned a lot more about Calculus, which helped me a lot in the class!
